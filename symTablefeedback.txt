A solid implementation!  It didn’t detect clashes between method parameters and local variables though — which would be easier to detect if you lumped parameters in with the locals in the var table.  Also, even after an error is detected, you keep on going, which would eventually allow programs with errors to be translated into assembly.  You should throw an exception and die if you find an error.  Finally, in one of my tests that had a redeclared variable, you claimed it occurred on line 0 when it clearly wasn’t.  95/100
